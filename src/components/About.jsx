        <p>
          Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold">Saru Chandrikha</span>, a passionate 
          <strong> Software Developer</strong> with a strong focus on building 
          modern, user-friendly, and scalable applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy turning ideas into reality through clean code and creative design. 
          Over the years, Iâ€™ve gained experience in 
          <span className="font-semibold"> Php, CodeIgniter, React, Laravel, Node.js, SQL, and TailwindCSS</span>. 
          Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies to stay ahead in this fast-evolving field.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond coding, I value <strong>collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous growth</strong>. 
          I believe in writing code that not only works but also makes life easier for the people who use it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m excited to contribute my skills to meaningful projects and grow with innovative teams. ðŸš€
